# JORJA PORTFLIO WEBSITE

Decided to experiment my front end skills by designing a music artist website. To be honest, I am simply winging it, might add other inspirations to it. 
A simple website, though simplistic approach; have a curtain reveal for a start. 
The artist of choice is Jorja Alice Smith. As the about states, this just an appreciation from a fan who happens to be a web dev.

## Plans
- To have a gallery section (showing example of her impressive photos),
- Links to her social media platforms
- Music on both spotify and youtube
- The background photo to loop over some selected photos

Simple rundown of the styles i would like to include soon:
    1. Change the font family to Belleza
    2. Modify the colors with the following palette: #0d0c0b, #3d3f43, #523524, #845331, #8c847f, #d3d2cc

## Features
1. Latest News:
- This could be borrowed from her twitter handle into cards that the user can readily read from the website. Could be anything (to say the least)
 2. Gallery 
- Thinking of making the background some of her old photos (reminiscent vibes). Changing background with her past old photos to more recent ones.
3. Music as users surfs:
- Interesting concept to introduce audio to the website.
4 Short Jorja life story:
- An intro or just borrow from any of her interviews and incorporate it into my creation.
5. Jorja Merch:
- Basically apparels that are on sale to fans. A link to such a online site.

# JORJA MUSIC WEBSITE

Decided to experiment my front end skills by designing a music artist website
Want to make it simple (nothing fancy for a start). The artist of choice is Jorja Alice Smith. 
Might make it duo color for a start. 
Fonts:  Belleza
Colors: #0d0c0b, #3d3f43, #523524, #845331, #8c847f, #d3d2cc
Gallery: to view some of her photos
Music: Listen to some of her songs.

##Bugs

    Adding colors to the social handles on hover.
    Creating overlay effect on the word 'Jorja Smith' + able to add text over it. 

## Features
    News: 
    This could be borrowed from her twitter handle into cards that the user can readily read from the website
    Gallery: 
    These are borrowed from instagram. 
    Thinking of making the background some of her old photos (reminiscent vibes). 

    Background: 
    On every page, as we continue to develop this, we can add simple shots of the artist and then make the layout minimalistic (not too much wording) - this will be effective. 

    Make the website play random song by jorja or featuring jorja
