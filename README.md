#JORJA MUSIC WEBSITE

Decided to experiment my front end skills by designing a music artist website
Want to make it simple (nothing fancy for a start). The artist of choice is Jorja Alice Smith. 
Might make it duo color for a start. 
Fonts:  Belleza
Colors: #0d0c0b, #3d3f43, #523524, #845331, #8c847f, #d3d2cc
Gallery: to view some of her photos
Music: Listen to some of her songs.


##Bugs

    Adding colors to the social handles on hover.
    Creating overlay effect on the word 'Jorja Smith' + able to add text over it. 

##Features
    News: 
    This could be borrowed from her twitter handle into cards that the user can readily read from the website
    Gallery: 
    These are borrowed from instagram. 
    Thinking of making the background some of her old photos (reminiscent vibes). 

    Background: 
    On every page, as we continue to develop this, we can add simple shots of the artist and then make the layout minimalistic (not too much wording) - this will be effective. 

    Make the website play random song by jorja or featuring jorja
